			<h3> What is this? </h3>
			<p> This is a website that allows you to view homework submissions for all periods of Mr. Mykolyk's APCS class, in order to review your homework. </p>
		</div>
                <div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 10%;">
                        <h3> How to use this: </h3>
                        <p> Go to <a href="http://moe.stuy.edu/~gthompson30/hv/">the main page</a>, and click "submissions" on the assignment that you wish to view. A table showing if each person has submitted their homework, and if so, their submission link, for viewing. You can also see statistics at the bottom of this page showing how many people have submitted the assignment. </p>
                </div>
		<div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 10%;">
			<h3> Why is the total # of submissions for HW23+ higher than before? / Why am I not listed for earlier assignments? </h3>
			<p> Because that's when I updated this to include people who got added to edihhh late. I could, in theory, run the script to check all of their submissions for before HW23, but that would be kind of tedious and unnecessary, given that you can already view ~77 submissions for HW00-HW22. </p>
		</div>
		<div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 10%;">
			<h3> I don't want to be listed here </h3>
			<p> No problem at all, just email me at gthompson30@stuy.edu, and I will promptly remove you from the list. However, your repo will still be listed on edihhh, and that's under Mykolyk's control, not mine, so anyone will still be able to access your repo, it just won't be listed <i> here </i>. I will try to set up a form in the future where people can enter in their name, and it will automatically be removed. </p>
		</div>
		<div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 10%;">
                        <h3> But how does it work? </h3>
			<p> This website runs on Python CGI. In order to check if everyone has submitted the homework, the code looks through everyone's repos,
			    as listed in the <a href="https://github.com/ap251/edihhh">"edihhh" repo</a> on ap251, and checks to see if they have the assignment
			    folder in their repo. If updates the <a href="http://moe.stuy.edu/~gthompson30/hv/json/completed.json">completed.json</a>, which stores
                            everyone's homework links, accordingly. This process is ran every 30 minutes, as part of a cron job.
			    Each time that somebody pings this website, the code retrieves this file, and parses, formats it
                            into HTML, and sends it back to the client. It's worth noting that the program doesn't check if what each submission is valid and, is not
			    just a template, because that would be very difficult to do and imprecise, so it's much easier to just manually look through the
			    submissions. The website is ran on the moe.stuy.edu server.

                        <h3> Why does this website look so bad? </h3>
                        <p> I notice that a lot of really good websites look really <strike>bad</strike> ... old, and I think this is partially because no more is really needed, and I like the sturdiness of old websites without too many fancy visual features. If I were to make this website look *better*, the styling would be sort of distracting. Also, I don't like designing websites.</p></li>
